# ResQ-AI Project Development Log

"Can you push the current code to my GitHub repository? Use the branch name 'Frontend' and set the message to 'frontend added'. Here is the link: https://github.com/kavindon2007/cellose"

"I need to start a new project called 'rescue-ai-project'. Set up a proper directory structure with a backend using Python and a frontend using React. Make sure to include folders for components, hooks, services, and some basic config files like .env and requirements.txt."

"I'm building an emergency response system called 'ResQ-AI' for a hackathon. It needs to be really high-end and modern. I want a form where people can type a description, upload photos or videos, and record voice messages. It should automatically get their GPS location. On the backend, try to figure out if it's a fire, medical, or police emergency and how serious it is. Also, build a live status tracker with a few steps so the user knows help is coming."

"I've made some manual changes to the files. Can you stage everything and commit it to the Frontend branch with the message 'updated file'?"

[2026-02-09 12:21:21]
"Install the necessary backend packages: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, python-multipart, and pydantic."

[2026-02-09 12:22:46]
"Here is the backend code I want to use for the FastAPI server. It handles the database, websockets for the status tracker, and some basic keyword-based logic to categorize the emergency. Please add this to the project."

[2026-02-09 12:26:43]
"Can you run both the backend and frontend now so I can see it working?"

[2026-02-09 12:28:28]
"I want to commit this new full-stack code to the Frontend branch. Use the commit message 'backend added'."
