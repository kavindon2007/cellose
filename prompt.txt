# ResQ-AI Project Development Log

[2026-02-09 12:13:07]
"Can you push the current code to my GitHub repository? Use the branch name 'Frontend' and set the message to 'frontend added'. Here is the link: https://github.com/kavindon2007/cellose"

[2026-02-09 12:14:49]
"I need to start a new project called 'rescue-ai-project'. Set up a proper directory structure with a backend using Python and a frontend using React. Make sure to include folders for components, hooks, services, and some basic config files like .env and requirements.txt."

"I'm building an emergency response system called 'ResQ-AI' for a hackathon. It needs to be really high-end and modern. I want a form where people can type a description, upload photos or videos, and record voice messages. It should automatically get their GPS location. On the backend, try to figure out if it's a fire, medical, or police emergency and how serious it is. Also, build a live status tracker with a few steps so the user knows help is coming."

[2026-02-09 12:19:08]
"I've made some manual changes to the files. Can you stage everything and commit it to the Frontend branch with the message 'updated file'?"

[2026-02-09 12:21:21]
"Install the necessary backend packages: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, python-multipart, and pydantic."

[2026-02-09 12:22:46]
"Here is the backend code I want to use for the FastAPI server. It handles the database, websockets for the status tracker, and some basic keyword-based logic to categorize the emergency. Please add this to the project."

[2026-02-09 12:26:43]
"Can you run both the backend and frontend now so I can see it working?"

[2026-02-09 12:28:28]
"I want to commit this new full-stack code to the Frontend branch. Use the commit message 'backend added'."


Project Title: ResQ-AI
Tagline: An On-Spot Emergency Response System powered by AI.
1. The Core Problem
Panic-Induced Delays: In emergencies, users often struggle to communicate details clearly due to stress or shock.
Information Gap: First responders often lack critical visual or location context before arriving at the scene.
Resource Mismanagement: Without proper prioritization, critical cases can get delayed behind minor incidents.
2. Our Solution: "Panic-Proof" Reporting
Multi-Modal Input System:
Text Description: Simple input for detailed reporting.
Media Uploads: Users can instantly capture and upload Images or Videos of the accident scene.
Voice Input (Innovation): A one-tap voice recorder for users who are unable to type, allowing for hands-free reporting.
Smart OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
Automatic Text Extraction: The system scans uploaded images to instantly read and digitize critical text—such as Vehicle License Plates or Street Signboards—saving valuable seconds during reporting.
Automatic Geolocation:
Instantly captures Live Latitude & Longitude to pinpoint the exact location without manual entry.
3. The AI "Brain" (Intelligent Processing)
Tier-Based Analysis (Priority Engine):
The system uses a sophisticated Tier System to rank incidents and allocate resources effectively:
Tier 1 (Critical): Immediate threat to life (e.g., Cardiac arrest, Major crash). Triggers an instant "Code Red" alert to all nearby units.
Tier 2 (High): Urgent but stable situations requiring rapid response.
Tier 3 (Standard): Non-life-threatening incidents handled with standard protocols.
Smart Classification:
Automatically routes the request to the correct department: Police, Ambulance, or Fire Department.
Automated Responder Briefing:
Generates a concise, "Well-Tuned Message" for responders, including the Tier Level, timestamp, and summary.
4. Real-Time Status Tracker (User Assurance)
Live Transparency:
Replaces uncertainty with a clear, visual timeline of the rescue operation.
The 6-Step Response Cycle:
Request Received
Tier Assigned (Analysis Complete)
Team Dispatched
On the Way
Action in Progress
Resolved
Visual Feedback: The active stage pulses (e.g., a green pulsing dot) to let the user know the system is working live.
5. Innovation & Accessibility Features
Multi-Language Support:
Includes a toggle for English and Local Language (e.g., Tamil) to ensure the app is accessible to everyone.
AI Chatbot Assistant:
A floating "AI Helper" widget to guide users who are confused or in shock.
Priority Notifications:
Visual urgency indicators (Red borders and badges) that escalate based on the Tier 1 status.
6. Technical Stack
Frontend: React (Vite) with Tailwind CSS for a high-performance, responsive mobile-first design.
Backend: Simulated AI Integration with OCR and Tier-Logic processing.
Design Philosophy: "Innovation-First" approach with high-contrast elements for visibility in stressful situations.
